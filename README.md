# going-forward
  From now on, there will be 2 projects per thing I learn. One project will showcase EVERYTHING I have learned and the other will be just a simple (or complex) fun project. Solely, I made this github account to share my lame projects (yes I know that they are lame), but I will try my hardest to proceed with my learning of computers and this account will be a diary of some sorts for me. 
  Recently, I learned html and css, but not javascript, yet. I also have started using archlinux with i3. Yesterday I  started learning python, so far, it doesnt seem that interesting, just overcomplicated things. Anyways, for projects (python-wise), that will have to wait another day or two or maybe three, depends. I am NOT leaving the C programming language, instead, I am working on building a simple kernel.

Thanks, ffdnxob.
